##Elevator Pitch
Imagine this: Hollywood. Flashing Lights. Fancy cars. Ryan Reynolds walking down your red carpet. Spontaneous Mint Mobile Ad... It's premier night at your film festival and streaming service in the Home of the Stars. Your theater is packed and all is well. The movies come and go, but then you see Ryan Reynolds walk away with his head down at the end of the night. You run to ask him if hes alright and he replies: "My film never made it on screen, and I can't even watch it on the app ðŸ˜ž". How could this happen!?! 

We know! You run your entire business from a set of ever growing Google Spreadsheets.

Well how do you fix it...?

First off, give Ryan Reynolds a hug he definitely needs it. And then subscribe to [insert cool name for web application here]! This is a database that allows you to track which films are at your festival and posted on your streaming service
